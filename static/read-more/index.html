            My body is flexible so that I can be easily coiled up for storage and easy transported. I am specially made to not scratch your piano and to not slip while you play your piano.

            My belly is shaped so that I can rest in the correct position on the back of your piano keyboard while still giving you enough room to comfortably play the keys. I fit any piano with full sized keys.

            I am a smart snake. I know how to talk to your piano through my tongue. You connect me to your piano with a USB cable. I can also connect to your computer.

            I have lights on my back so I can show you which key to press. There is one light for each key on your piano.

            <div class="readHeader">Share your piano</div>
            I can talk to my sister PlugAndPlink snakes using the Internet. This lets you share your piano with other plinkers (that&#39;s what we snakes call you humans who use PlugAndPlink). Piano sharing works in both directions. I can talk with any other snake, she can talk with me.

            You control me with an app on your phone. My app guides you how to connect me to your piano and lets you test that everything is working properly. My app is free to install on your phone. You need an account to use PlugAndPlink. The account is also free. You can also use my app to ask for help if you need it.

            <div class="readHeader">Lights on another Piano</div>
            When you play notes on your piano, the same notes play on your partner&#39;s piano. Your partner can be your teacher or can be anyone else who you know who has a PlugAndPlink snake, but for now let&#39;s assume you are sharing your piano with your piano teacher. When your teacher plays a note then a light on my back shows you what your teacher played. Only people who know you can connect to your snake this way, so I am safe to use on the Internet.

            <div class="readHeader">Lights on your Piano</div>
            Watching lights on my back is much easier than trying to look at your phone on a video call with your teacher. Each time you have to look away at your phone you have to remember what you have seen from a different angle, then find your place again on your own keyboard and try to copy what you saw. It gets really confusing. Lights on your keyboard triggered by your teacher are far less confusing to follow.

            <div class="readHeader">Notes Played from Afar</div>
            The notes I receive from your teacher&#39;s snake do not just show as lights on my back. I can also copy the notes which your teacher plays, and play them on your piano. Hearing notes from your own piano is much clearer than listening to your teacher&#39;s piano through a video call. When two
plinkers play a duet - then the sound is nicely balanced because you are both playing the same piano.
