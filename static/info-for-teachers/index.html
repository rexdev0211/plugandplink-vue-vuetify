This means you can safely refer a pupil to our website or our in-app help documents where he or she will find all of the information in straightforward text.</p>				<p>This document gives more background into the intentions behind PlugAndPlink.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">Please watch the video first</div>				<p>The video on this website is the quickest way to understand the purpose of PlugAndPlink. The remainder of this text assumes you have seen the animated video.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">Notes you play show as lights on your pupil's piano</div>				<p>The video illustrates that the benefit of using PlugAndPlink is effected by enabling any note you play on your piano to show as a light on your pupil's piano above the corresponding key. This simplifies explaining piano playing as it is equivalent to pointing to the pupil's keyboard while sat next to him or her. Pupils prefer to keep their gaze on the keyboard than have to look away. Lights on the keyboard are therefore the most convenient way to point out individual keys.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">Notes you play sound on your pupil's piano</div>				<p>It is much clearer for the pupil to hear your playing and their playing from the same source than rely on the audio of your own piano through the video call. You can accompany your pupil's playing with a sound which is balanced because the pupil will hear only sound from their own piano.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">You still need a video call</div>				<p>To make use of PlugAndPlink you still need a video call. However, there is no need to position cameras towards the piano keyboards in order to show your playing to your pupil. You will find that it is more useful to position your phone or tablet as you would for a normal face to face call.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">There is no difference between teacher and pupil</div>				<p>The snake and the app are the same in every respect for both teacher and pupil. This means your local snake is guaranteed to be identical to operate as your pupils'. Even though you may not need to see the notes your pupil plays or hear their playing through your piano it is useful to remain familiar with the exact same setup.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">Aural training</div>				<p>You have the option to temporarily suppress showing lights on the remote snake. This allows you to play the pupil's piano without the pupil seeing the notes you play. This is useful for aural training. 'Sing this melody', 'Sing the lower of the two notes in this chord', 'Clap this rhythm', 'What is the time signature of this song'. In all of these cases, the lights would be a distraction and misleading for the pupil.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">Snakes required</div>				<p>You will need a snake. Each pupil you teach remotely will need their own a snake. We issue coupons which apply a discount to the price of additional snakes after you purchase your first snake.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">App required</div>				<p>There is an app which you must install to use PlugAndPlink. The app allows you to:</p>				<ul>					<li>create an account so that you can use PlugAndPlink and contact us for support</li>					<li>be guided how to setup your snake and test that everything is working correctly</li>					<li>engage in a piano sharing session</li>					<li>access our help and support services consisting of searchable documents and a support chat</li>				</ul>				<p>The app can be installed to an Android or an Apple phone or tablet. The app is free to download, install and use. You are welcome to download the app and browse its functions before purchasing snakes. The snake, the app and all accompanying materials and examples are written to be comprehensible to an eight year old piano student. We do not rely on you, the teacher, to assist with setting up the snake and we have taken care to make the app as simple to use as possible. We are very					open to comments and suggestions as to how our product can be improved. We are constantly updating the app, the software which runs the snake and the infrastructure which enables snakes to communicate using the Internet.</p>			</div>		</div>		<div class="readMoreSection">			<div class="readContent">				<div class="readHeader">Security</div>				<p>We store only minimal information about each user.
